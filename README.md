Smart Waste Classification and Recycling Assistant
Professional README
1. Project Synopsis
The Smart Waste Classification and Recycling Assistant is a comprehensive research and development project focused on leveraging advanced machine learning to automate the sorting of waste for recycling. This initiative moves beyond simple classification to explore a multi-faceted approach, incorporating techniques for data robustness and deployment readiness. The core objective is to deliver a suite of interconnected solutions, from sophisticated image classification models to generative pipelines for data augmentation and a practical, real-time demo application.

2. Core Components & Methodologies
This repository is a showcase of cutting-edge deep learning techniques applied to a critical environmental challenge. The project's architecture is modular, with each component designed to address a specific aspect of building a robust and scalable AI-powered system.

Waste Classification Models:

Transfer Learning: A highly accurate classification pipeline built on a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 architecture (TensorFlow/Keras).

Custom CNN: A bespoke Convolutional Neural Network trained from the ground up to provide a lightweight, purpose-built alternative for classification tasks.

Robustness & Data Augmentation:

Denoising Autoencoder (PyTorch): An unsupervised learning model designed to preprocess and clean noisy input images, enhancing the performance of subsequent classification models.

Conditional GANs (PyTorch): A conditional DCGAN-style pipeline for synthesizing a diverse range of class-specific waste images, crucial for augmenting limited datasets and improving model generalization.

Multimodal Integration:

CLIP-based Classifier (PyTorch): A novel approach that fuses image and short text embeddings to create a multimodal classification system, providing a richer, more contextual understanding of waste items.

Object Detection:

YOLOv8 Notebook: An optional but critical component for transitioning from image classification to object detection, enabling the identification and localization of waste items within a larger image.

Interactive Demonstration:

Streamlit Application: A user-friendly web application (streamlit_app.py) that allows for real-time, single-image inference using the trained models. It serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for the project's capabilities.

4. Dataset
The primary dataset used for training and evaluation is the publicly available Garbage Classification dataset from Kaggle. The notebooks are designed to automatically handle the dataset's standard directory structure, which includes six core classes: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.

5. Getting Started
To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

Place the Dataset: Ensure the Garbage Classification dataset is placed in the expected path or update the relevant path variables within the notebooks.

Set Up the Environment: Install the necessary dependencies. A single environment is possible, but separate PyTorch and TensorFlow environments are recommended to avoid conflicts.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Experiments: Execute the Jupyter notebooks in a logical sequence as outlined in the report_Abdelrhman_Wael_Ahmeda.ipynb file to train the various models.

Launch the Demo: Once the models are trained and saved, launch the Streamlit application to interact with the system.

Bash

streamlit run "./streamlit_app.py"
